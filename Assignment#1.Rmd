### Why I am taking ESM262
I am taking ESM 262 because I want to learn more about functions and how to use them more intricatly. I would also love to know more about the caret and stick packages for training models.

### My data science experience
I have taken ESM 244 and ESM 206. My GP is also using a fair amount of modeling to model for changes in soil carbon with regenrative agriculture.
